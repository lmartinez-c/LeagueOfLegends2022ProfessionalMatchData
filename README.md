## Introduction

In this project, I studied which league has the most “action-packed” games? Is the amount of “action” in this league significantly different than in other leagues?
The data set used was collected from 2022 League of Legends professional match data.
The raw data contained 149400 rows, and 123 columns. However, for my research purposes only data from the columns:
```py
['kills', 'deaths', 'assists', 'doublekills', 'triplekills', 'quadrakills', 'pentakills', 'damagetochampions', 'damagetakenperminute', 'damagemitigatedperminute']
```
